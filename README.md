# Word Whacker
A crossplatform desktop zen / minimalist text editor for creative writing.

Word Whacker has some support for Markdown and you can preview a formatted markdown output. But all of the editing in Word Whacker is raw text.

## Platforms

Testing it myself in Windows and Mac. There's also an experimental web version but it doesn't have full functionality.
