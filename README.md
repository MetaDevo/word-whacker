# WordWhacker
A crossplatform desktop zenware / minimalist text editor for focused writing.

WordWhacker has some support for Markdown and you can preview a formatted markdown output. But all of the editing in Word Whacker is raw text.

## Platforms

Window, Mac, Linux. There's also an experimental web version but it doesn't have full functionality.
Dependencies

## Build

The quickest way is to open the CMakeLists.txt file in QtCreator and build from there.
